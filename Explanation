This Use Case Diagram represents the Dashboard and Alert Ingestion modules of a SOAR system. Security Analysts and SOC Analysts use the dashboard to monitor alerts, view details, filter alerts, and track incident status. The SIEM system sends security alerts to the SOAR platform, where alerts are normalized, classified by severity, optionally enriched with threat intelligence, and stored in the database. The dashboard provides summarized and detailed alert information, and analysts can generate reports when needed. Include relationships represent mandatory processing steps, while extend relationships represent optional actions such as report generation and threat intelligence enrichment.
