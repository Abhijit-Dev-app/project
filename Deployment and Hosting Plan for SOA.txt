Deployment and Hosting Plan for SOAR Platform
1. Host Site (Target Server / Cloud)

For our SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform, we are planning to deploy the system on Amazon Web Services (AWS) because it provides scalability, reliability, and strong security features.

Component-wise Hosting Plan

Frontend (Dashboard UI – React): Hosted on AWS EC2 or AWS Amplify.

Backend (Node.js API Server): Hosted on AWS EC2 instance.

Database (MySQL): Hosted on AWS RDS or MongoDB Atlas.

Automation Engine: Deployed on the same EC2 server inside the secure cloud network.

Alert Logs & Storage: Stored securely in AWS S3.

Email Notifications: Configured using AWS Simple Email Service (SES).

Monitoring & Logs: Managed using AWS CloudWatch.

All components will be deployed inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure secure internal communication.

2. Deployment Strategy
Step 1: Server Configuration

Create a cloud virtual machine (EC2 instance) with Linux operating system.

Install required runtime environment for backend.

Configure a web server (like Nginx) to manage incoming traffic.

Open only required ports (HTTP/HTTPS).

Restrict SSH access for security.

Step 2: Backend Deployment

Upload backend application files to the server.

Install necessary dependencies.

Configure environment variables for database and external tools.

Start backend service and ensure it runs continuously.

Connect backend with database and security tool APIs.

Step 3: Frontend Deployment

Build the frontend application.

Host it either on AWS Amplify or serve it using the web server.

Configure it to communicate securely with backend APIs using HTTPS.

Step 4: Database Configuration

Deploy managed database service (RDS or MongoDB Atlas).

Enable automated backups.

Restrict database access only to backend server.

Enable encryption for stored data.

Step 5: API Communication Setup

Frontend communicates with backend using secure REST APIs.

Backend communicates with:

Security tools (IDS, firewall, email systems)

Automation engine

Database server

Internal communication happens within private cloud network for security.

3. Security Measures

Since SOAR is a cybersecurity platform, strong security mechanisms are applied.

1. Network Security

Use cloud firewall (Security Groups) to allow only necessary ports.

Restrict SSH access to authorized IP addresses.

Deploy all servers inside private VPC.

2. Encryption

Use HTTPS with SSL certificates.

Encrypt database at rest.

Use secure TLS encryption for API communication.

3. Authentication & Authorization

Implement secure login system.

Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Admin

Security Analyst

Viewer

Use token-based authentication for API access.

4. Logging and Monitoring

Log all user activities for auditing.

Monitor server performance and suspicious activity using cloud monitoring services.

Store historical incident data securely.

5. Backup and Disaster Recovery

Enable automatic database backups.

Maintain daily backup of logs and reports.

Prepare recovery plan in case of server failure.
