II. Application Components
1. Ingestion & Normalization Component
Function: Acts as the entry point for "Security Tools" and "SIEM Systems." It validates raw alerts and transforms them into a standardized JSON format for the rest of the pipeline.

2. Analytics & Correlation Engine
Function: Correlates multiple alerts into a single "Incident" to reduce alert fatigue. It performs the Risk Assessment (Process 4.0) to determine the severity and priority of the threat.

3. Playbook Orchestrator
Function: The central logic controller that fetches rules from the Playbook Repository (D2) and triggers the Response Execution (e.g., blocking an IP or isolating a host).

4. Case Management System
Function: The primary interface for the Security Analyst. It handles "Incident Reporting," "Incident Status Tracking," and allows for manual intervention in the automated workflow.

5. Integration Gateways (Adapters)
Function: Specialized components that handle communication with external entities like the Threat Intel Platform and Identity Providers (for Login/Authentication).

6. Logging & Audit Service
Function: A background component (Process 8.0) that records every action taken by the system and users into Incident Records (D3) for legal and compliance purposes.
