#1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to formally specify the requirements for the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Platform.
This platform aims to automate the detection, analysis, and response to cybersecurity incidents by integrating multiple security tools and executing predefined response workflows.

1.2 Scope

The SOAR platform will:

Collect security alerts from multiple sources

Correlate and prioritize incidents

Automate incident response actions

Provide dashboards and reports for security teams

Reduce manual effort and response time during security incidents

The system is intended for use by Security Analysts, SOC teams, and System Administrators.

1.3 Definitions and Acronyms

SOAR: Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response

SOC: Security Operations Center

Incident: A security event requiring investigation or response

Playbook: A predefined automated response workflow

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

The SOAR platform is a centralized security automation system that integrates with existing security tools such as:

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Firewalls

SIEM tools

Endpoint Security Systems

It acts as an orchestration layer on top of these tools.

2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
User Type	Description
Security Analyst	Monitors alerts, investigates incidents
SOC Manager	Reviews reports and incident trends
System Administrator	Manages system configuration and integrations
2.3 Operating Environment

Web-based application

Runs on cloud or on-premise infrastructure

Supports modern web browsers

Backend hosted on Linux-based servers

2.4 Design Constraints

Must ensure secure handling of sensitive security data

Must support role-based access control

Should be scalable for large volumes of alerts
