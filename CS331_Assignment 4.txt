1. Choose an appropriate software architecture style (like Layered Architecture, Microservices Architecture, Monolithic Architecture, Service-OrientedArchitecture, etc.) for your software engineering project. Also,
A. Justify how your software architecture falls in that specific category by defining the granularity of the software components.

For this SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform, a Microservices Architecture is the most appropriate choice. This style decomposes the application into a suite of small, independent services, each running its own process and communicating via lightweight mechanisms (typically an HTTP API or Message Broker).

A. Justification by Component Granularity
The granularity of the software components, as identified in the Level 1 DFD and Use Case Diagram, aligns with independent service boundaries:

1. Ingestion & Normalization Service: A high-granularity service focused solely on receiving raw data from "Security Tools" and translating it into a common schema.

2. Analytics & Risk Engine: A specialized service for "Alert Correlation" and "Risk Assessment" that can be updated independently of the ingestion logic.

3. Playbook Orchestration Service: A core logic service that interacts with the "Playbook Repository" to execute automated responses.

4. Case Management & Audit Service: Manages analyst interactions and handles long-term storage in "Incident Records".

5. Identity & Access Service: A dedicated component for "Login/Authentication" and "RBAC," ensuring security is centralized but decoupled from business logic.




B. Justify why this software architecture style is the best choice for your software engineering project considering scalability, maintainability,performance, and other requirements.

This architecture style is the best choice for a SOAR platform based on the following requirements:

1. Scalability: Security alerts often arrive in massive bursts (e.g., during a DDoS attack). We can horizontally scale the Alert Ingestion and Normalization services specifically to handle the load without needing to scale the entire platform.

2. Maintainability: SOAR platforms must frequently integrate with new third-party security tools. We can develop and deploy a new "Connector" or "Playbook" service without redeploying the core system, reducing the risk of regression errors.

3. Performance & Fault Tolerance: If the Threat Intel Enrichment service (shown in the UML) experiences a delay, it will not block the Response Execution. This isolation ensures critical defensive actions are never blocked by non-critical data enrichment.

4. Technology Diversity: Different components require different tech stacks. The Risk Assessment module can be built using Python for its data science libraries, while the Ingestion Engine can be built in Go/Java for high-concurrency performance.




2. Mention the components present in your software engineering project (i.e. application components).

1. Ingestion & Normalization Component
Function: Acts as the entry point for "Security Tools" and "SIEM Systems." It validates raw alerts and transforms them into a standardized JSON format for the rest of the pipeline.

2. Analytics & Correlation Engine
Function: Correlates multiple alerts into a single "Incident" to reduce alert fatigue. It performs the Risk Assessment to determine the severity and priority of the threat.

3. Playbook Orchestrator
Function: The central logic controller that fetches rules from the Playbook Repository and triggers the Response Execution (e.g., blocking an IP or isolating a host).

4. Case Management System
Function: The primary interface for the Security Analyst. It handles "Incident Reporting," "Incident Status Tracking," and allows for manual intervention in the automated workflow.

5. Integration Gateways (Adapters)
Function: Specialized components that handle communication with external entities like the Threat Intel Platform and Identity Providers (for Login/Authentication).

6. Logging & Audit Service
Function: A background component that records every action taken by the system and users into Incident Records for legal and compliance purposes.
